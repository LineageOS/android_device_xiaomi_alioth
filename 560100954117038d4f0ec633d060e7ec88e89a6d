However to me simply \"setprop persist.vendor.sys.fp.vendor fpc\" is already proven to work.",

      "message": "Honestly I didn\u0027t anticipate building the whole ROM myself because as far as I know everything needed to fix this was merely one line to be added to /vendor/build.prop. If it\u0027s really unacceptable to add such one line to /vendor/build.prop (even if Xiaomi has done something similar) or if doing so won\u0027t fix it (like, as I have tested, directly editing /vendor/build.prop on device \u0026 reboot didn\u0027t seem to take effect; or is there other variant of alioth which has fingerprint vendor other than \"fpc\"?), I\u0027ll probably try to build the ROM myself, however this obviously will take some time...",
